Test 1: Tune LATERAL_KP (forward/backward)

Upload code to robot
Run driver control
Press DOWN on D-pad - this runs testDriveStraight() which drives 24 inches forward
Watch what happens:

Does it stop too early and not reach 24"? → INCREASE LATERAL_KP (try 7.0, then 10.0, etc.)
Does it overshoot and go past 24"? → DECREASE LATERAL_KP (try 4.0, then 3.0, etc.)
Does it oscillate back and forth around the target? → Perfect! This is too high. Back off 20% (if KP=10 and it oscillates, use 8.0)


Repeat: Change value, upload, test again until you find the value that JUST BARELY oscillates
Final value: Reduce by 20% from oscillation point

Test 2: Tune LATERAL_KD

Start with: LATERAL_KD = LATERAL_KP * 5 (e.g., if KP=8.0, use KD=40.0)
Press DOWN again - does it still oscillate?

YES → INCREASE LATERAL_KD (try 50.0, 60.0, etc.)
NO, but it's slow/sluggish → DECREASE LATERAL_KD (try 30.0, 20.0, etc.)



Test 3: Tune ANGULAR_KP (turning)

Press RIGHT on D-pad - this runs testTurn90() which turns 90 degrees
Same process as LATERAL_KP:

Stops short? → INCREASE ANGULAR_KP
Overshoots? → DECREASE ANGULAR_KP
Oscillates? → You found the limit, back off 20%



Test 4: Tune ANGULAR_KD

Start with: ANGULAR_KD = ANGULAR_KP * 5
Test turning - adjust until smooth

Test 5: Timeout Values

Watch the terminal output during tests
If you see "Movement timed out" but robot is still moving → INCREASE timeout values
If robot reaches target but sits there for 1+ seconds → DECREASE timeout values
